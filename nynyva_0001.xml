    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>In 1994, the artist Frank Moore and arts writer David Hirsh formed the Archive Project to protect the legacies of artists who were being lost to the AIDS crisis. Moore and Hirsh were joined by Roberto Juarez, Sur Rodney (Sur), Eric Rhein, Geoff Hendricks, Ken Chu, and David Cabrera in this endeavor, and the group soon merged with Visual AIDS.</p><p>The founding principle of the Archive Project was to support any and all self-identified HIV positive artists, without adjudication. To make this possible, the project focused on creating and collecting photographic documentation of artist's work, rather than attempting to store and conserve the art objects themselves. Artists were solicited to join the archive through flyers, posters, and personal outreach. Volunteer photographers would visit artists in their homes or studios to document and catalog their artwork, providing the artist with a copy of the slides and depositing a copy into the Artist File collection. Artists (and the friends and families of deceased artists) also contributed press clippings, resumes, exhibition cards and other biographical materials to their artist files. The Artist File collection has continued to grow since its establishment in 1994, with an emphasis on digital photographs rather than slides since the late 2000s. </p><p>In the early 2000s, Visual AIDS produced several calendars featuring artwork by artists living with HIV, the Positively Art Calendar. Materials related to this competition are included in several artist files and consist of a combination of submission forms, images of artwork, and artist statement. </p><p>In addition to material donated by artists and estates, Artist Files include material related to Postcards from the Edge, a yearly Visual AIDS fundraiser. For this fundraiser, Visual AIDS solicits artwork from artists and any submission forms and unsold artworks are then added to Artist Files. </p><p>In 2014, Visual AIDS launched an online Artist Registry (visualaids.org/artists), which includes digitized images from the Artist File collection as well as images uploaded directly by artists and estates. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Artist Files collection includes personal papers and records pertaining to the lives and work of artists living with HIV and AIDS, as well as those who have passed. The collection primarily consists of photographic documentation of artwork (both physical and digital), exhibition materials, publications, ephemera, correspondence, and personal papers and photographs. The collection contains a small number of artworks on paper, primarily unsold contributions to Visual AIDS' Postcards from the Edge fundraiser.</p>  </scopecontent>

He studied at St. Olaf's College, Los Angeles City College, and the University of Minnesota. His work used dense geometric patterning centered around the cteno, the Greek prefix for a five-pronged, comb-like for typically associated with zoological and aquatic creatures (for example, the comb jelly Ctenophora). Knudsvig's systems, ultimately, find the esoteric in the human; "five fingers," as the artist wrote in a diary entry, is "the pre- cursor to all ctenos." These figures have associations with counting, time, DNA and ancient text. His work was exhibited in New York.
